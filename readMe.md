# Arkanoid

### Intro
This is a version of Arkanoid for my dad, but it's realised by me.

### Idea

- [x] add a system of point
- [ ] store the name of player
- [x] upgrade the rebound of the ball
- [x] upgarde the design of the decoration
- [ ] add a system of time combine with the score
- [ ] add the real bar of arkanoid (with complex rebound) => specific branch
- [ ] if r is pressed but the game has start, restart completely (like after gameover)
- [x] with random level generator, display win when a new high score is reached before the game over.
- [ ] Use vector (like Processing JS) => specific branch
- [ ] Make the ball increase each time it hits a brick.
- [ ] make a level of difficulty in terms of speed (easy, medium and hard)
